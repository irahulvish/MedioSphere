MedioSphere Orders Database Management and Analytics
Overview
The MedioSphere project is a comprehensive SQL-based solution designed to analyse and manage thousands of medicine orders data for an e-commerce-like platform called MedioSphere. The project involves cleaning and modelling raw datasets in Excel, importing them into a MySQL database, and performing hundreds of advanced SQL queries to extract actionable insights and requirements for the MedioSphere organisation. This project demonstrates expertise in database design, data analysis, and query optimization, effectively showcasing the ability to handle large datasets and derive meaningful results.

Key Features
1.	Data Preparation and Modelling:
o	Cleaned and structured raw datasets (1000+ rows) using Excel, ensuring data consistency and readiness for analysis.
o	Modelled the dataset into three core components: Users (customers), Products (medicines), and Orders (transaction details).
2.	Database Design:
o	Created the MEDICO_ORDERS MySQL database with normalized relational tables to manage data efficiently.
o	Defined schema with appropriate keys, constraints, and indexes for optimized query performance.
3.	Advanced SQL Querying:
o	Performed complex queries, including joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions, to analyse:
ï‚§	Revenue trends by product and customer.
ï‚§	Top-selling medicines and high-value customers.
ï‚§	Monthly and yearly sales patterns.
o	Ensured data accuracy and query performance with optimization techniques.

How to Run the Project
1.	Prepare the Environment:
o	Install MySQL and a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
o	Install Excel or equivalent for data preparation (if starting from raw data).
2.	Setup the Database:
o	Use the schema.sql file to create the database and tables.
o	Import the cleaned CSV files into the respective tables.
3.	Run Queries:
o	Execute queries provided in the queries.sql file to generate insights.
4.	Optional Extensions:
o	Modify queries or datasets to explore additional use cases.

Future Enhancements
â€¢	Add more tables (e.g., Shipping, Payments) for expanded functionality.
â€¢	Integrate with a frontend application for real-time data visualization.
â€¢	Automate data cleaning and importing using Python scripts.
